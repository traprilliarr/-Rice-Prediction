# -Rice-Prediction-Fuzzy Time
The fuzzy time project encompasses a graphical user interface (GUI) application using the Tkinter library for rice prediction. It incorporates calculations for two prediction methods, namely FTS (Fuzzy Time Series) and EHO (Enhanced Harmony Search Optimization), and subsequently computes and displays the Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE) metric for assessing prediction accuracy. Users can input a dataset through an Excel file, select their preferred prediction method, and execute the program. The application then processes the data, presents the prediction outcomes in a tabular format, and showcases visualizations. This code serves as a valuable resource for creating an interactive platform to facilitate rice prediction while integrating FTS, EHO, and MAPE calculations.
